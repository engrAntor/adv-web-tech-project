# adv-web-tech-project
This is a full-stack project built for my Advanced Programming with Web Technologies course. The backend is powered by Nest.js and the frontend is built with Next.js.


Students can register and log in to the system. They can view and edit their profile information, including their profile picture. Students can browse offered courses, register for them, take quizzes, and track their course progress. They can also view their registered courses, make payments to confirm their course registration, and log out of the system.
